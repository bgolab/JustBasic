JustBasic-full1.bas, JustBasic-full2.bas are used during regression (automatic) tests
JustBasic-PICO.bas - will track PICO hardware support updates

NOTES:
- some hardware related examples / features are targetted for Promoni Explorer Base board (buttons, graphic, etc), later other displays will be supported
- it is assumed that POKE / PEEK will be used to address missing hardware features (see systick example) - NOTE: PEEK / POKE were not heavily tested - use them at your own RISK
