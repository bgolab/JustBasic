NOTE on released binary files:

1. SRAM builds (have NO suffix or '_sram' suffix) - compiled with 'no_flash' option, no flashing needed, just drag & drop the image into the PICO emulated disk
2. FLASH builds (have '_flash' suffix) - are targeted for those who want to flash the interpreter to the PICO (those builds are not tested now)
