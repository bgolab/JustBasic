NOTES:
- bxx suffix is to indicate the beta releases for particalular official version e.g. 1.0b11 means beta 11 version for the target release 1.0
- since the save / load commands are not supported yet ALL current build are compiled with 'no_flash' options; 
this means they are targetted for RAM only (no flashing required then, just drag & drop in PICO USB emulated disk)
